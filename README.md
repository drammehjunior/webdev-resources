## Here I will share everything you will need to ace your web development work and be more productive. Everthing at one place!

# Code Editors:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): This is the best editor for web development in my opinion. I have been using VS Code since a long time. What makes VS Code special is the extension marketplace. You can make this editor as your own with different themes, fonts and wide variety of extension. 
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): Sublime, a very light-weight text editor, great for beginners and intermediate web developers, it too has a wide variety of extensions and themes. It can be used for quick fixes in your code.
